## Annotate para-PS1/PM5 criteria with a custom variant dataset for any gene family

Requirements (examples can be obtained from the example folder): 
<li>Select alignment file of your gene family of interest. Prennotated alignment files can be obtained from https://github.com/dlal-group/PERs. Upon using the alignment files please cite the original publication <a href = "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6961572/">PÃ©rez-Palma et al., 2020</a></li>
<li>Upload your custom set of pathogenic variants which will be considered as evidence if present in a paralogous gene if conserved and present at the same protein alignment position.</li>
